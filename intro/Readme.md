####What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
* Reading and writing
* Attention to detail
* Spotting differences

####Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing are the outward signs that one can use language to communicate
with other people using technologies from books to computers.

Attention to detail is particularly important in programming since the great bulk
of code lies hidden beneath the surface, and it must all be correct for things to
work correctly. 

The ability to spot differences may refer to anything from performance to the 
look of things. I find that judicious use of white space in the layout of my
code greatly helps spot irregularities.

####Why do you need to not copy and paste?

In the present context where we're forming linkages between what we see,
what we understand, and how we operate the machine through typing, copy and paste
defeats much of the purpose to establish a basic skill set.

####Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Of course it is. Drills are the essence of every craft. They develop speed, 
alacrity, and professionalism.
