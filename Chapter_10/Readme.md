#### Chapter_10

Study Drills:
1) Add the escape sequences to your Anki deck
2) Explain the difference between these two in the Readme.md
3) Add these escape sequences to your ex10.rb file.

```
"These two"? Assume this refers to single quotes vs. double quotes.
Single quotes are not interpreted and double quotes are interpreted.
Single quotes carry the picture image and double quotes carry the
resolved image after logic, format, substitution, etc. have been done.
```

```
Once again, Rubocop gets very chirpy about the triple quote syntax
so I just load the string across multiple lines using one set
of double quotes.
