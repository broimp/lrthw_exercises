#### Chapter_7

http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex7.html
Study Drills:
1) Add comments to ex7.rb
2) Read ex7.rb to one of you fellow students
3) Feel free to document the mistakes you make in Evernote.
4) ...
5) This is a lie, your instructor never makes mistakes. ;-)
Q) Please explain the difference between puts and print in your own 
words in the Readme.md.

Use puts to output a string with a line feed.
Use print to output a string without a line feed, when processing
(read or write) must continue at the end of the output string.

Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper
 what kind of mistake you made.
When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made
 and try not to make them in this new one.
Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians
 who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong,
  but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
