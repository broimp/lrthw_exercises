#### Chapter_4

The undefined local variable or method error comes from trying to
use a vairable that has not been instantiated yet. Instantiated means
"set equal to something." It usually arises from a typo of a variable
name.
qwhich is essentially an integer. A 4.0 will type to Float, which
are more precise and include significant digits.

The puts command will represent its own string interpretation of
Fixnum and Float variables, unless it is further modified with
a format method.
